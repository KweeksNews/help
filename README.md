## Introduction

KweeksHelp (KweeksNews Help Center) built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/) and hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) to provide guidance on using the services on the KweeksNews Network.

## Getting Started

1. Set up the development environment

   You need to set up your development environment before you can do anything.

   Install [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

2. Install the dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run in development mode

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   
   This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Deployment

```bash
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
